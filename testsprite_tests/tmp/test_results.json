The Catalogue Generator page was accessed and verified to support batch uploads via a drag & drop interface. However, actual file uploads to simulate high frequency API requests and concurrent batch job submissions could not be performed due to environment constraints. Consequently, direct verification of API rate limiting responses and autoscaling behavior was not possible. Further testing with actual file uploads and network monitoring is recommended to fully validate rate limiting and autoscaling under high load.\nBrowser Console Logs:\n[WARNING] ⚠️ React Router Future Flag Warning: React Router will begin wrapping state updates in `React.startTransition` in v7.
